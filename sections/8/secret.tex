We have reviewed the proposed design of access control to the
data~\cite[sec. 3]{8} and found both alternatives to be strong
solutions.

The report chooses Shamir's Secret Sharing (SS) as the best
solution~\cite[p. 13]{8}, which we would agree as it is a tried and
true cryptographic system.

An implementation vulnerability that is not clearly mentioned in the
report would be an availability attack. If an adversary would perform
a Denial of Service (DoS) attack on the share holders, or even
physically destroy the hardware storing the share, all data could
become lost as not enough shares is left to decrypt. Naturally, this
should be made infeasible as enough shares should be distributed, with
a good margin for loosing keys should be expected, so this will never
happen.
