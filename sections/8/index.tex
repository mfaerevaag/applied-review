In this section we will review group 8's report on secure camera
surveillance~\cite{8}. We will barely touch into the risk analysis,
but rather focus our review on the design of the proposed
system~\cite[sec. 3]{8}, first looking at weaknesses in the given
design and eventually suggesting an alternative solution. Lastly we
will conclude with our overall assessment of the system.
